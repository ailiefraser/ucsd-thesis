\chapter{ReMap: Multimodal Help-Seeking}
One of the notable findings from our studies with RePlay was that people are often reluctant to search even when it would be beneficial, because they felt it would take more time than trial-and-error exploration. However, trial-and-error often ended up taking a long time or not resulting in the correct solution. How might we lower the barrier to searching for help?

This chapter introduces ReMap, an extension to RePlay that aims to make searching easier and faster by incorporating multimodal interaction. Users can speak search queries, adding app-specific terms deictically. Users can navigate ReMap's search results via speech or mouse. An initial study showed that ReMap helped people stay focused on their task while simultaneously searching for and using help resources. This study along with iterative prototyping and pilot testing also raised a number of important challenges with incorporating multimodal features into a help-seeking system.
