\chapter{ReMap: Multimodal Help-Seeking}
\label{chapter:remap}

People are reluctant to search for help when they feel it will take more time than trial-and-error exploration, even with a contextual search system like RePlay. However, trial-and-error often takes a long time or does not result in a correct solution. Given this cognitive bias, how might we lower the barrier to searching for help? This chapter aims to make searching easier and faster through multimodal interaction. We introduce \textit{ReMap}, an extension to the RePlay system that allows users to speak search queries, adding application-specific terms deictically. Users can navigate ReMap's search results via speech or mouse. A lab study showed that ReMap helped people stay focused on their task while simultaneously searching for and using help resources. Users' experiences with ReMap also raised a number of important challenges with incorporating multimodal features into a help-seeking system.
