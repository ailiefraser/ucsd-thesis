\section{Conclusion}
ReMap demonstrates multimodal interaction for quick, in-context help-seeking by leveraging the strengths of multiple modalities. Users can search for videos using speech, use deixis to include app-specific terminology, and use speech to navigate videos. Initial usage showed that ReMap helps people stay focused on their task while navigating help resources, but further research is needed to provide robust deictic resolution and fully explore its potential for help-seeking.
