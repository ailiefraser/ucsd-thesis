\section{Discussion / Challenges}
\subsection{Implementation Challenges}
- having to be a macos app because accessibility, but no good speech so having to use web speech api
- accessibility in general not super good --> deictic failed a lot
\subsection{Usability Challenges}
- searching unintentionally (midas touch)
- or not listening when keyword was misheard
- cutting off before they were done talking
- correcting query is hard, mostly resort to typing or people would repeat themselves but system isn't that smart
- showing query as they spoke might have been distracting - they weren't looking at the task anymore
\subsection{Potentail IMprovements / future exploration to do}
- compare keyword to search vs. button / keyboard shortcut
- let user decide when done talking (adds extra step but could prevent errors)
- explore how to correct queries (existing work?) using speech -- detect if they repeat themselves and go with the second version, or suport things like "x instead of y"
- compare not showing query (just listening) vs. showing it
- other ways to do deictic -- computer vision like prefab?
- higher level -- do people really want deictic? is it useful? most queries (as we found with replay too) were not about tools so being able to refer to them isn't that useful, and other things (like objects on the canvas) people mostly know what they are called so it doesn't save much time
- deictic may be more useful for issuing commands or sending questions to people / posting in forums
