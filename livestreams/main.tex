\chapter{Sharing the Studio: How Creative Livestreaming can Inspire, Educate, and Engage}

%Artists communicate and share their creative work through online galleries, creative communities, and social media. While some go further and also share works-in-progress or videos of their process, these still present a selective, edited view. Livestreaming, in contrast, allows creators to share an authentic, unedited view of their process while they work. 
Many artists livestream their creative process, allowing viewers to learn and be inspired from the decisions -- and mistakes -- they make along the way. This paper presents the first broad look at the range of creative activities people stream. Through content analysis of livestream archives, interviews with 8 streamers, and online surveys with 165 viewers, we study current practices and challenges in creative livestream communities and compare them with prior observations of livestreaming in other domains. We observed four common types of creative livestreams: teaching, making, socializing, and performing. We identify three open questions for the research community around how to better support the goals of creative streamers and viewers: how to support richer audience interactions at scale, how to support all parts of the creative process, and how to support watching livestream archives.


% % STATE OF THE WORLD
% Many artists working with both digital and physical tools livestream their process as they work on a project.
% % THE BIG BUT
% Despite this, research on livestreaming has primarily focused on gaming, pedagogical, and software engineering use cases. 
% % PROBLEM
% As a result, livestreaming platforms are not always designed with creative work in mind. 
% %<SOME PROBLEM HERE: maybe something about how livestream communities and tools are designed for screensharing, making assumptions like artists will have their hands or eyes free to pay attention to chat, etc.>
% % INSIGHT
% %By understanding creative livestreams, we can broaden our understanding of how to design streaming tools for a large portion of the livestreaming community.
% % APPROACH
% We present a first comprehensive look at creative livestreams, a growing medium where people share a window into their work as it unfolds. 
% % WHAT WE DID
% Through content analysis of livestream archives, online surveys with 165 viewers, and interviews with 8 streamers, we address current challenges in online creative livestream communities and compare them with prior observations of livestreaming in other domains.
% %we build on our understanding of livestreaming practices by focusing on the space of creative livestreams. We address current challenges in these online communities and compare them with prior observations of livestreaming. 
% We find that, unlike other domains, one of the main reasons viewers watch creative livestreams is for inspiration and motivation. One dominant challenge that emerged for streamers was balancing between their work and interacting with viewers. This is especially difficult for creative work, which often requires the artist's full attention. We propose opportunities for future research to better support the needs of viewers and streamers of creative work.
% %Or a lot of artists who livestream are not educators, so they are not used to that kind of multitasking.
