\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented the first broad look at creative livestreams, a growing medium where artists share their creative process live online. We conducted a content analysis of livestream archives, interviews with 8 streamers, and online surveys with 165 viewers. Four common types of creative livestreams emerged: Teaching, Making, Socializing, and Performing. Varying streamer and viewer goals accompany each. Finally, we proposed open questions for future work to better understand and support creative livestream communities. These communities have exploded in popularity, and as they continue to grow it will be important to design platforms to support their needs. We believe that telepresent creative work will only get bigger from here, as people have more ways than ever to share their passions with the world.
