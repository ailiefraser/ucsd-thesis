\chapter{LiveClips: Contextual Recommendation of Inspirational Clips from Live Streamed Videos}
\label{chapter:liveclips}
\begin{quote}
Tutorials are helpful for accomplishing specific goals, but people do not always have a particular outcome in mind when using creative software -- sometimes users seek resources for general learning or inspiration. One such resource is live streamed videos, where artists share a window into their creative process. This chapter explores the benefits and challenges of using such videos for learning and inspiration.
%Through content analysis of live stream archives, interviews with 8 streamers, and online surveys with 165 viewers, we study current practices and challenges in creative live stream communities and compare them with prior observations of live streaming in other domains. We observed four common types of creative live streams: teaching, making, socializing, and performing. 
We find that despite the wealth of expert knowledge in live stream archives, their length and volume makes them hard to search or browse. To address this challenge, we introduce \textit{LiveClips}: a system for automatically selecting inspirational segments from live streamed videos and recommending them to users in the context of their creative workflow. We present three methods for recommending and displaying video clips with varying levels of contextual support, and implement them in a popular creative application, Adobe Photoshop. We compare the accuracy of LiveClips' clip ranking to human ranking and present initial user feedback on the three prototypes.
