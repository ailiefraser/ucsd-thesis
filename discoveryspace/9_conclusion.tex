\section{Conclusion}
This chapter introduced Discovery\-Space, a task-level action suggestion interface, and found that easy-to-execute task-level action suggestions may help prevent novices from losing confidence with complex software. Discovery\-Space allows users to more easily discover what is possible in an application by abstracting away individual commands in favour of understandable and goal-driven actions. By suggesting actions relevant to the user's input document, Discovery\-Space can provide useful assistance toward accomplishing the user's task. The experiment described in this chapter confirmed the need for interventions like this in modern software, and provided results suggestive of the fact that action suggestions are beneficial to users. The next chapter explores how contextual suggestions can help novices accomplish tasks in a different domain: providing feedback.
