\begin{quote}
Complex software offers power for experts, yet overwhelms new users. Novices often get lost in the many steps required to achieve their goals, and may not even know what goals are possible. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Discovery\-Space} interface for executable action suggestions. Discovery\-Space is a prototype extension panel for Adobe Photoshop that suggests task-level action macros to apply to photographs based on visual features. Discovery\-Space harvests these one-click actions from the online Photoshop user community. A between-subjects study indicated that action suggestions may help novices maintain confidence, accomplish tasks, and discover features. This work demonstrates how interfaces can leverage user-generated content to help novices achieve expert-level outcomes in complex software.
