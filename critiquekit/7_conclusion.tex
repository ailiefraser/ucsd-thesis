\section{Conclusion}
Looking across the deployments and experiments, adaptive suggestions and interactive guidance significantly improved feedback while static suggestions did not offer significant improvements. These techniques were embodied in the CritiqueKit system, used by 95 feedback providers and 336 recipients. Future work should examine applying other attributes of helpful feedback and further investigate how best to create, curate, and display adaptive suggestions. 

Much knowledge work features both underlying principles and context-specific knowledge of when and how to apply these principles. Potentially applicable feedback and review areas include domains as disparate as hiring and employee reviews, code reviews, product reviews, and reviews of academic papers, screenplays, business plans, and any other domain that blends context-specific creative choices with common genre structures. We hope that creativity support tools of all stripes will find value in the ideas and results presented here.
