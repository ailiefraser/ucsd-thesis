abstract = {A leading M.I.T. social scientist and consultant examines five professions, engineering, architecture, management, psychotherapy, and town planning to show how professionals really go about solving problems. The best professionals, Donald Schön maintains, know more than they can put into words. To meet the challenges of their work, they rely less on formulas learned in graduate school than on the kind of improvisation learned in practice. This unarticulated, largely unexamined process is the subject of Schön's provocatively original book, an effort to show precisely how reflection-in-action works and how this vital creativity might be fostered in future professionals. Part 1. 1. The crisis of confidence in professional knowledge -- 2. From technical rationality to reflection-in-action -- Part 2. 3. Design as a reflective conversation with the situation -- 4. Psychotherapy : the patient as a universe of one -- 5. The structure of reflection-in-action -- 6. Reflective practice in the science-based professions -- 7. Town planning : limits to reflection-in-action -- 8. The art of managing : reflection-in-action within an organizational learning system -- 9. Patterns and limits of reflection-in-action across the professions -- Part 3. Conclusion. 10. Implications for the professions and their place in society.},

abstract = {The ability to engage in real-time text conversations is an important feature on live streaming platforms. The moderation of this text content relies heavily on the work of unpaid volunteers. This study reports on interviews with 20 people who moderate for Twitch micro communities, defined as channels that are built around a single or group of streamers, rather than the broadcast of an event. The study identifies how people become moderators, their different styles of moderating, and the difficulties that come with the job. In addition to the hardships of dealing with negative content, moderators also have complex interpersonal relationships with the streamers and viewers, where the boundaries between emotional labor, physical labor, and fun are intertwined.

abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

abstract = {How do comments on student writing from peers compare to those from subject-matter experts? This study examined the types of comments that reviewers produce as well as their perceived helpfulness. Comments on class-mates' papers were collected from two undergraduate and one graduate-level psychology course. The undergraduate papers in one of the courses were also commented on by an independent psychology instructor experienced in pro-viding feedback to students on similar writing tasks. The comments produced by students at both levels were shorter than the instructor's. The instructor's comments were predominantly directive and rarely summative. The under-graduate peers' comments were more mixed in type; directive and praise comments were the most frequent. Consistently, undergraduate peers found directive and praise comments helpful. The helpfulness of the directive com-ments was also endorsed by a writing expert. A s Richard Haswell (2005) noted in a recent article, peer review of undergraduate writing seems to be " the least studied of practices now very common in college writing classrooms " (p. 211). In fact, while conducting the first comprehensive review of research on any kind of college-level peer assessment, Keith Topping (1998) found only 67 empirical studies to include.},

@article{Chi1996,
abstract = {SUMMARY One-on-one tutoring is a form of instruction that requires interaction between a tutor and a tutee. The effectiveness of tutoring is examined from the perspectives of the tutor's actions, the tutee's actions, and successive interactions. A tutor's actions that may not lead to successive interactions consist of asking an initiating question, providing feedback, and asking a comprehension-gauging question. It is suggested that these types of actions can lead to the learning of an ideal template of solution procedures for solving problems, but may not lead to deep understanding. A tutee's actions are postulated as self-explaining, in response to either tutors' questioning, tutors' prompting, or tutors' scaffolding. Finally, an interaction is defined as a sequence of tutor actions, such as scaffolding, which elicits a successive series of exchanges between the tutor and tutee, so that they collaboratively construct a response. An exercise in a detailed protocol analysis of a case study of a student being tutored in solving a mechanics problem is presented. It shows what misconceptions the student exhibited, whether these misconceptions were removed, and what actions triggered the learning. The results of this case study support the suggestion that tutor actions that prompt for co-construction (which includes self-explanation) may be the most beneficial in producing deep learning, in the sense of removing misconceptions.},

@article{Greer2004,
abstract = {To achieve higher flexibility and to better satisfy actual customer requirements, there is an increasing tendency to develop and deliver software in an incremental fashion. In adopting this process, requirements are delivered in releases and so a decision has to be made on which requirements should be delivered in which release. Three main considerations that need to be taken account of are the technical precedences inherent in the requirements, the typically conflicting priorities as determined by the representative stakeholders, as well as the balance between required and available effort. The technical precedence constraints relate to situations where one requirement cannot be implemented until another is completed or where one requirement is implemented in the same increment as another one. Stakeholder preferences may be based on the perceived value or urgency of delivered requirements to the different stakeholders involved. The technical priorities and individual stakeholder priorities may be in conflict and difficult to reconcile. This paper provides (i) a method for optimally allocating requirements to increments; (ii) a means of assessing and optimizing the degree to which the ordering conflicts with stakeholder priorities within technical precedence constraints; (iii) a means of balancing required and available resources for all increments; and (iv) an overall method called EVOLVE aimed at the continuous planning of incremental software development. The optimization method used is iterative and essentially based on a genetic algorithm. A set of the most promising candidate solutions is generated to support the final decision. The paper evaluates the proposed approach using a sample project.},

abstract = {Existing knowledge is a vital prerequisite for creativity. It provides a central source of inspiration for new ideas and determines the pathways available for creative problem solving. Notwithstanding its indisputable role, knowledge may also compromise creativity. The human mind is prone to reproduce what it is used to, and the provision of explicit knowledge constitutes a potential inhibitor of imagination. Hence, IT systems supporting creative work have to support creative individuals by extending their personal knowledge while, at the same time, preventing them from merely walking down beaten tracks. In this article, grounded in theory on human cognition and literature on creativity support, we propose a design theory for IT systems that support both convergent and divergent thinking, that is, the central cognitive processes in creative work. We provide details on a prototypical implementation, discuss an illustrative case from the creative industries in order to demonstrate the design's applicability, and outline plans for an empirical evaluation of the proposed design theory.},

abstract = {"This book focuses on the human users of search engines and the tool they use to interact with them: the search user interface. The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems"--Provided by publisher. The design of search user interfaces -- The evaluation of search user interfaces -- Models of the information seeking process -- Query specification -- Presentation of search results -- Query reformulation -- Supporting the search process -- Integrating navigation with search -- Personalization in search -- Information visualization for search interfaces -- Information visualization for text analysis -- Emerging trends in search interfaces.},

"IDEO founder and Stanford d.school creator David Kelley and his brother Tom Kelley, IDEO partner and the author of the bestselling The Art of Innovation, have written a powerful and compelling book on unleashing the creativity that lies within each and every one of us. Too often, companies and individuals assume that creativity and innovation are the domain of the "creative types." But two of the leading experts in innovation, design, and creativity on the planet show us that each and every one of us is creative. In an incredibly entertaining and inspiring narrative that draws on countless stories from their work at IDEO and with many of the world's top companies, David and Tom Kelley identify the principles and strategies that will allow us to tap into our creative potential in our work lives, and in our personal lives, and allow us to innovate in terms of how we approach and solve problems. It is a book that will help each of us be more productive and successful in our lives and in our careers."-- Introduction: The heart of invention -- Flip : from design thinking to creative confidence -- Dare : from fear to courage -- Spark : from blank page to insight -- Leap : from planning to action -- Seek : from duty to passion -- Team : creatively confident groups -- Move : creative confidence to go -- Next : embrace creative confidence.},

@article{Foster2003,
abstract = {“Serendipity” has both a classical origin in literature and a more modern manifestation where it is found in the descriptions of the problem solving and knowledge acquisition of humanities and science scholars. Studies of information retrieval and information seeking have also discussed the utility of the notion of serendipity. Some have implied that it may be stimulated, or that certain people may “encounter” serendipitous information more than others. All to some extent accept the classical definition of serendipity as a “fortuitous” accident. The analysis presented here is part of a larger study concerning the information‐seeking behaviour of interdisciplinary scholars. This paper considers the nature of serendipity in information‐seeking contexts, and reinterprets the notion of serendipity as a phenomenon arising from both conditions and strategies – as both a purposive and a non‐purposive component of information seeking and related knowledge acquisition.},

abstract = {The present study examined the effectiveness of (a) peer feedback for learning, more specifically of certain characteristics of the content and style of the provided feedback, and (b) a particular instructional intervention to support the use of the feedback. A quasi-experimental repeated measures design was adopted. Writing assignments of 43 students of Grade 7 in secondary education showed that receiving ‘justified' comments in feedback improves performance, but this effect diminishes for students with better pretest performance. Justification was superior to the accuracy of comments. The instructional intervention of asking assessees to reflect upon feedback after peer assessment did not increase learning gains significantly.},

This study investigates the relationship of video game genres, content type and viewer gratification in the context of live gaming. To study this phenomenon, we employ an online questionnaire study (N = 1097) to investigate six categories of gratifications: affective, information seeking, learning to play, personal integrative, social integrative {\&} tension release motivations and their relationship with game genres and stream types. The results of this study demonstrate that “the medium is the message”, highlight the importance of archetypal structure (i.e. the type of streamed content) over content topic (i.e. the genre of games being streamed), and help to build a better understanding of user generated content and the democratization of media.},

@book{Gay2004,
abstract = {The shift in the practice of human-computer interaction (HCI) Design from user-centered to context-based design marks a significant change in focus. With context-based design, designers start not with a preconceived idea of what users should do, but with an understanding of what users actually do. Context-based design focuses on the situation in which the technology will be used -- the activities relating to it and their social contexts. Designers must also realize that introduction of the technology itself changes the situation; in order to design workable systems, the design process must become flexible and adaptive. In Activity-Centered Design, Geri Gay and Helene Hembrooke argue that it is time to develop new models for HCI design that support not only research and development but also investigations into the context and motivation of user behavior. Gay and Hembrooke examine the ongoing interaction of computer systems use, design practice, and design evaluation, using the concepts of activity theory and related methods as a theoretical framework. Among the topics they discuss are the reciprocal relationship between the tool and the task, how activities shape the requirements of particular tools and how the application of the tools begins to reshape the activity; differing needs and expectations of participants when new technology is introduced, examining in particular the integration of wireless handheld devices into museums and learning environments; and the effect of the layout of the computing space on movement, function, and social interaction. Gay and Hembrooke then apply their findings on the use of technology in everyday contexts to inform future HCI design practice.},

@article{Hu2017,
abstract = {Live video streaming has been a global economic and social phenomenon in recent years. Many streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube Live have been founded and demonstrated unprecedented growth across the world. Yet, researchers have paid insufficient attention to understanding the massive participation behavior exhibited by live video streaming audiences. Based on social identity theory, this paper aims to explain audiences' continuous watching behavior intention via a dual identification framework including identifications with streaming broadcasters and audience groups. Analysis of data collected from two live streaming platforms in mainland China indicates that audiences' identification with broadcasters and audience groups are positively associated with their continuous watching intention. Broadcaster identification is driven by individual experience including experience of parasocial interaction, actual and ideal self-congruity, whereas group identification is enhanced by co-experience consisting of participation, cognitive communion, and resonant contagion. In addition, live streaming genres partially moderate the impact of identification on continuous watching intention. Theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations and suggestions for future research are provided.},

@article{Chugh2015,
abstract = {Direct manipulation interfaces and programmatic systems have distinct and complementary strengths. The former provide intuitive, immediate visual feedback and enable rapid prototyping, whereas the latter enable complex, reusable abstractions. Unfortunately, existing systems typically force users into just one of these two interaction modes.   We present a system called Sketch-n-Sketch that integrates programmatic and direct manipulation for the particular domain of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). In Sketch-n-Sketch, the user writes a program to generate an output SVG canvas. Then the user may directly manipulate the canvas while the system immediately infers a program update in order to match the changes to the output, a workflow we call live synchronization. To achieve this, we propose (i) a technique called trace-based program synthesis that takes program execution history into account in order to constrain the search space and (ii) heuristics for dealing with ambiguities. Based on our experience with examples spanning 2,000 lines of code and from the results of a preliminary user study, we believe that Sketch-n-Sketch provides a novel workflow that can augment traditional programming systems. Our approach may serve as the basis for live synchronization in other application domains, as well as a starting point for yet more ambitious ways of combining programmatic and direct manipulation.},

@article{Hutchins1985,
abstract = {Direct manipulation has been lauded as a good form of interface design, and some interfaces that have this property have been well received by users. In this article we seek a cognitive account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena that give rise to the feeling of directness. One deals with the information processing distance between the user's intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling of directness of manipulation.},

abstract = {Assembly is the capstone process for product realization where component parts and subassemblies are integrated together to form the final products. As product variety increases due to the shift from mass production to mass customization, assembly systems must be designed and operated to handle such high variety. In this paper we first review the state of the art research in the areas of assembly system design, planning and operations in the presence of product variety. Methods for assembly representation, sequence generation and assembly line balancing are reviewed and summarized. Operational complexity and the role of human operators in assembly systems are then discussed in the context of product variety. Challenges in disassembly and remanufacturing in the presence of high variety are presented. We then conjecture a future manufacturing paradigm of personalized products and production and discuss the assembly challenge for such a paradigm. Opportunities for assembly system research are summarized at the end of the paper.},

Three chess players of varying strength — from master to novice — were confronted with two tasks: (1) A perception task, where the player reproduces a chess position in plain view, and (2) de Groot's (1965) short-term recall task, where the player reproduces a chess position after viewing it for 5 sec. The successive glances at the position in the perceptual task and long pauses in the memory task were used to segment the structures in the reconstruction protocol. The size and nature of these structures were then analyzed as a function of chess skill.},

This study uses bug-related tutoring feedback (BRT-feedback) offering strategic information for error correction, but no immediate KCR. In a computer-based learning experiment with 50 fourth-grade pupils having learning difficulties in written subtraction, cognitive and motivational effects of this BRT-feedback algorithm were compared to the effects of a traditional KR–KCR-feedback algorithm. Results show that BRT-feedback is significantly more beneficial for achievement and motivation than KR–KCR-feedback.},

abstract = {In comparison to multiple choice or other recognition-ori-ented forms of assessment, short answer questions have been shown to offer greater value for both students and teachers; for students they can improve retention of knowledge, while for teachers they provide more insight into student under-standing. Unfortunately, the same open-ended nature which makes them so valuable also makes them more difficult to grade at scale. To address this, we propose a cluster-based interface that allows teachers to read, grade, and provide feedback on large groups of answers at once. We evaluated this interface against an unclustered baseline in a within-sub-jects study with 25 teachers, and found that the clustered in-terface allows teachers to grade substantially faster, to give more feedback to students, and to develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions.},

Multimodal interfaces support mobility and expand the expressive power of human input to computers. They have shifted the fulcrum of human-computer interaction much closer to the human. This book explains the foundation of human-centered multimodal interaction and interface design, based on the cognitive and neurosciences, as well as the major benefits of multimodal interfaces for human cognition and performance. It describes the data-intensive methodologies used to envision, prototype, and evaluate new multimodal interfaces. From a system development viewpoint, this book outlines major approaches for multimodal signal processing, fusion, architectures, and techniques for robustly interpreting users' meaning. Multimodal interfaces have been commercialized extensively for field and mobile applications during the last decade. Research also is growing rapi...},

abstract = {A video database can contain a large number of videos ranging from several minutes to several hours in length. Typically, it is not sufficient to search just for relevant videos, because the task still remains to find the relevant clip, typically less than one minute of length, within the video. This makes it impor tant to direct the users attention to the most promising material and to indicate what material they already investigated. Based on this premise, we created a video search system with a powerful and flexible user interface that incorporates dynamic visualizations of the underlying multimedia objects. The system employes an automatic story segmentation, combines text and visual search, and displays search results in ranked sets of story keyframe collages. By adapting the keyframe collages based on query relevance and indicating which portions of the video have already been explored, we enable users to quickly find relevant sec tions. We tested our system as part of the NIST TRECVID interactive search evaluation, and found that our user interface enabled users to find more relevant results within the allotted time than other systems employing more sophisticated analysis techniques but less helpful user interfaces.},

In order to manage these communities, platform owners have increasingly turned to commercial content moderation, which includes both the use of moderation algorithms and the employment of professional moderators, rather than user-driven moderation, to detect and respond to anti-normative behaviors such as harassment and spread of offensive content. We present findings from semi-structured interviews with 56 volunteer moderators of online communities across three platforms (Twitch, Reddit, and Facebook), from which we derived a generalized model categorizing the ways moderators engage with their communities and explaining how these communities develop as a result. This model contains three processes: being and becoming a moderator; moderation tasks, actions, and responses; and rules and community development. In this work, we describe how moderators contribute to the development...},

abstract = {Despite advances in speech technology, human factors research since the late 1970s has provided only weak evidence that automatic speech recognition devices are superior to conventional input devices such as keyboards and mice. However, recent studies indicate that there may be advantages to providing an additional input channel based on speech input to supplement the more common input modes. Recently the authors conducted an experiment to demonstrate the advantages of using speech-activated commands over mouse-activated commands for word processing applications when, in both cases, the keyboard is used for text entry and the mouse for direct manipulation. Sixteen experimental subjects, all professionals and all but one novice users of speech input, performed four simple word processing tasks using both input groups in this counterbalanced experiment. Performance times for all tasks were significantly faster when using speech to activate commands as opposed to using the mouse. On average, the reduction in task time due to using speech was 18{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}. The error rates due to subject mistakes were roughly the same for both input groups, and recognition errors, averaged over all the tasks, occurred for 6{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} of the speech-activated commands. Subjects made significantly more memorization errors when using speech as compared with the mouse for command activation. Overall, the subjects reacted positively to using speech input and preferred it over the mouse for command activation; however, they also voiced concerns about recognition accuracy, the interference of background noise, inadequate feedback and slow response time. The authors believe that the results of the experiment provide evidence for the utility of speech input for command activation in application programs.},

In this paper, we test the popular but unevenly supported hypothesis that conceptually distant sources of inspiration provide the best insights for creative production. Through text analysis of hundreds of design concepts across a dozen different design challenges on a Web-based innovation platform that tracks connections to sources of inspiration, we find that citing sources is associated with greater creativity of ideas, but conceptually closer rather than farther sources appear more beneficial. This inverse relationship between conceptual distance and design creativity is robust across different design problems on the platform. In light of these findings, we revisit theories of design inspiration and creative cognition.},

Each classified area is extensively surveyed, and special emphasis is given to trends in recent research. Specific papers involving nonrenewable resource constraints and time/cost-based objectives are discussed in detail because they present models that are close representations of real-world problems. The difficulty of solving such complex models by optimization techniques is noted. For the purposes of this survey, a set of 78 optimally solved test problems from the literature and a second set of 110 benchmark problems have been subjected to analysis with some well-known dispatching rules and a scheduling algorithm that consists of a decision-making process utilizing the problem constraints as a base of selection. The computational results are reported and discussed in the text. Constructive scheduling algorithms that are directly based on the problem constraints...},

We find that exposure to examples increases conformity. Early expo-sure to examples improves creativity (measured by the number of common and novel features in drawings, and subjective ratings by independent raters). Repeated exposure to examples interspersed with prototyping leads to even better results. However, late exposure to examples increases conformity, but does not improve creativity.},

@article{Shehory1998,
abstract = {Task execution in multi-agent environments may require cooperation among agents. Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which they have to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should be attached to a group of agents that will perform the task. Task allocation to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot be performed by a single agent. However it may also be beneficial when groups perform more efficiently with respect to the single agents' performance. In this paper we present several solutions to the problem of task allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest that the agents form coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve the efficiency of their performance. We present efficient distributed algorithms with low ratio bounds and with low computational complexities. These properties are proven theoretically and supported by simulations and an implementation in an agent system. Our methods are based on both the algorithmic aspects of combinatorics and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. We first present an approach to agent coalition formation where each agent must be a member of only one coalition. Next, we present the domain of overlapping coalitions. We proceed with a discussion of the domain where tasks may have a precedence order. Finally, we discuss the case of implementation in an open, dynamic agent system. For each case we provide an algorithm that will lead agents to the formation of coalitions, where each coalition is assigned a task. Our algorithms are any-time algorithms, they are simple, efficient and easy to implement.},

Learners should ask the most questions when their knowledge is well matched to the level of presentation. To test this hypothesis, we tested learners with two levels of background knowledge using learning material with two levels of difficulty. The learners were instructed to say aloud all their questions and thoughts while learning. With the easier material, novice learners asked more, questions than trained learners; with the harder material, trained learners asked more questions than novice learners. The results suggest that any theory of question asking in learning should consider the interaction between the levels of knowledge of the asker and of the material.},

The feedback is related to grammar, usage, mechanics, style, and organization and development. The major research question in this study is whether the feedback report is helpful for students in subsequent revisions of their essays. Helpful feedback can guide students in revising an essay, and will result in a better feedback report for the essay in subsequent re-submissions (i.e., one that has fewer critical comments). A positive feedback report has significant instructional implications and it also supports the validity of Criterion, since an iterative feedback and revision process is natural to the writing process. Criterion provides a way of automating and speeding up this process with its diagnostic feedback and essay scoring capabilities.},

abstract = {In this paper, emerging technologies in the automotive assembly are discussed, along with techniques used in the vehicle assembly plants. The discussion involves technologies directly dealing with assembly processes such as handling, joining, human resources etc. as well as with supporting systems, mainly the information technologies. An overview of the existing technologies is provided. The assembly systems are unable to cope with the requirements of mass customization and need to be enriched with new technologies for a higher flexibility potential. Concepts integrating various new technologies into supporting both automated and human based assembly operations are presented and discussed versus this identified inability for mass customization. Future assembly plants need to utilize flexibility systematically, both for the system design and its operation. For this purpose, a close loop approach is discussed.},

@article{Hilvert-Bruce2018,
abstract = {Little is known about the motivations underlying viewer engagement in the rapidly growing live-streaming multimedia phenomenon. This study trialled an eight-factor socio-motivational model, based on Uses and Gratifications Theory, to explain four aspects of live-stream viewer engagement. Cross-sectional data was collected through an international, online self-report survey of Twitch users (N = 2227). Multiple and ordinal linear regression analyses identified six motivations which helped to explain live-stream engagement: social interaction, sense of community, meeting new people, entertainment, information seeking, and a lack of external support in real life. Compared to mass media, viewer motivations to engage in live-stream entertainment appear to have a stronger social and community basis. Furthermore, live-stream viewers who preferred smaller channels ({\textless}500 viewers) were more motivated by social engagement than viewers who preferred larger channels. These findings offer insight into the motivations for live-stream engagement, and help to lay a foundation for further research.},

The purpose of this study is to establish a framework on which future research can be built. In-depth interviews with four artists-a sculptor, painter, fiber artist, and metalsmith-representing different media disciplines are described and analyzed; that analysis suggests that (1) artists make substantial use of libraries and print materials, (2) much of this material is not art related, (3) they typically find this material by browsing within specific subject areas, and (4) they make substantial use of interpersonal sources to obtain technical information and information about developments in the local art scene. To aid future research in this area and to tap into larger, more reliable samples, these data have been used to design a survey instrument that is described in an appendix to the study.},

@article{Stanney2004,
abstract = {As technology advances, systems are increasingly able to provide more information than a human operator can process accurately. Thus, a challenge for designers is to create interfaces that allow operators to process the optimal amount of data. It is herein proposed that this may be accomplished by creating multimodal display systems that augment or switch modalities to maximize user information processing. Such a system would ultimately be informed by a user's neurophysiological state. As a first step toward that goal, relevant literature is reviewed and a set of preliminary design guidelines for multimodal information systems is suggested.},

@inproceedings{Krause2017,
abstract = {Designers have turned to online crowds for fast and affordable feedback. However online contributors may lack the motiva-tion, context, and sensitivity to provide high-quality critique. Rubrics help critiquers, yet require domain experts to write them. This paper introduces automatic methods of extracting style-based language features to support feedback providers. Such style-based guides may benefit online feedback sys-tems. In Study 1, 52 students across two design courses cre-ated artifacts and received feedback from 176 online feedback providers. Instructors, students, and crowd contributors rated the helpfulness of each point of feedback. From this data an algorithm extracted a set of natural language features (e.g., specificity, sentiment etc.) that correlate with helpfulness rat-ings. The features accurately predict helpfulness and remain stable across different raters and design artifacts. Based on these features, we designed a critique style guide with auto-matically picked examples for each feature that support cri-tique providers to self-assess and edit their initial critique. Study 2 validates the guide with a between-subjects experi-ment (n=50). Participants gave feedback on design artifacts with or without the guide. Providers generated critiques with significantly higher perceived helpfulness when using style-based guidance.},

abstract = {Technology facilitates advances in learning and drives learning paradigms. One recent innovation is Twitch™, an online streaming platform often used for video game tutorials but also enables amateur online instruction (Hamilton, Garretson, {\&} Kerne, 2014)). Twitch represents a unique learning paradigm that is not perfectly represented in previous technologies because of its “ground-up” evolution and the opportunity for novice instructors to educate mass audiences in real-time over the Internet while enabling interaction between teachers and learners and among learners. The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the efficacy of Twitch as a learning platform by manipulating each of the key characteristics of Twitch and to understand the conditions in which novice instructors may be beneficial. Drawing from Cognitive Load Theory, we demonstrate the worked-example effect in the Twitch environment by manipulating teacher-learner-learner interactions, live versus recorded streaming, and expert-versus novice-based instruction. Based on a laboratory experiment involving 350 participants, we found that learning performance under novice instructors was at least as good as that of experts. However, an exploratory analysis of learner personalities revealed that extroverts benefit only when learner-learner interaction is enabled. Surprisingly, those who are highly agreeable and less neurotic benefited more from novice instructors.},

abstract = {The Writing Pal (W-Pal) is an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) designed to improve students' writing proficiency via a unique combination of explicit strategy instruction, game-based practice, essay writing practice, and automated formative feedback. To develop and refine the many features of the W-Pal tutoring system, we have employed a multiple-method usability testing approach, which capitalizes on the complementary strengths and weakness of methods such as focus groups, component studies, internal testing, and in vivo testing. These diverse methods allow researchers to benefit from focused student input, instructor input, and iterative development, while also gathering data in ecologically-valid settings. In this paper, we describe some of the testing and development of aspects of W-Pal, consider the challenges of building such a system, and provide a particular emphasis on a feasibility study that integrated W-Pal into high school English classrooms during a school year. The results of this study showed that students perceived the system as informative, valuable, and enjoyable, and results also highlighted specific ways that these aspects of the system could be further enhanced. Based upon these findings, a significantly updated version of W-Pal has been developed. The current W-Pal system is described along with considerations for future research and how the system may be used to supplement writing instruction.},

abstract = {The purposes of this study were to explore the effects and the validity of on-line peer assessment in high schools and to analyze effects of various types of peer feedback on students. The participating students, a total of 184 10th graders, developed their individual course projects by involving the on-line peer assessment learning activities in a computer course. The peer assessment activities consisted of three rounds, and each of the students acted as an author and a reviewer. Research data as evaluated from peers and experts indicated that students significantly improved their projects as involving the peer assessment activities. The scores determined by the learning peers were highly correlated with those marked by the experts, indicating that peer assessment in high school could be perceived as a valid assessment method. Moreover, this study also examined the relationships between the types of peer feedbacks in which students obtained from peer assessment and the subsequent performance of their projects. We categorized peer feedbacks into four types: Reinforcing, Didactic, Corrective and Suggestive. It was found that Reinforcing peer feedback was useful in helping students' development of better projects; however, Didactic feedback and perhaps Corrective feedback provided by peers might play an unfavorable role for subsequent improvement of students' projects.

We introduce a neural network method to encode programs as a linear mapping from an embedded precondition space to an embedded postcondition space and propose an algorithm for feedback at scale using these linear maps as features. We apply our algorithm to assessments from the Code.org Hour of Code and Stanford University's CS1 course, where we propagate human comments on student assignments to orders of magnitude more submissions.},

@article{Shneiderman1982,
abstract = {Abstract This paper suggests three motivations for the strong interest in human factors' aspects of user interfaces and reviews five design issues: command language versus menu selection, response time and display rates, wording of system messages, on-line tutorials, explanations and help messages and hardware devices. Five methods and tools for system development are considered: participatory design, specification methods, software implementation tools, pilot studies and acceptance tests and evolutionary refinement based on user feedback. The final portion of the paper presents direct manipulation, an approach which promises to become widely used in interactive systems. Direct manipulation involves representation of the object of interest, rapid incremental reversible actions and physical action instead of complex syntax.},

Through this analytical lens, we find that web tutorials serve a variety of needs, providing: in-task help for users with an immediate, specific goal to accomplish; a means for users to proactively expand their repertoire of skills; and an opportunity for novices to shadow and experience an expert's work practices. We also find a number of emergent practices in tutorial comments. Users post "help-me" stack traces, a type of comment useful for debugging tutorial content; use comments sections as opportunistic support forums; and turn to comments sections for social and technical validation of their personal skill sets. Collectively, these findings enrich existing perspectives on web-based tutorials and argue for new mechanisms to support these various use cases.},

A review of the developing literature follows, including both process and outcome studies. This indicates that peer assessment is of adequate reliability and validity in a wide variety of applications. Peer assessment of writing and peer assessment using marks, grades, and tests have shown positive formative effects on student achievement and attitudes. These effects are as good as or better than the effects of teacher assessment. Evidence for such effects from other types of peer assessment (of presentation skills, group work or projects, and professional skills) is, as yet, more limited. Computer-assisted peer assessment is an emerging growth area. Important factors in successful implementation are summarized, and recommendations for future research and practice are made.},
